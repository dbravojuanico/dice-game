## HOW?

When you click on the button it takes a random string from an array of valid images sources, and changes the visual face of the dice. At the same time disables the button and waits for the other player to roll.

When both players hace a value/face, they are compared and a result/winner appears on scree.

Finally, after a timeout, the game resets automatically.
